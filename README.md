# COVID-19 Dashboard

This repo contains the dashboard for a coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) project. 

The project's goals were to (1) build a machine learning model to predict the number of total cases and deaths due to COVID-19, (2A) evaluate whether governments were successful in containing the spread of COVID-19, and (2B) determine which government measures lead to better outcomes. 

Screenshots of the dashboard are included below.
